# 📦 E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes customer and transaction data from an e-commerce platform to identify key drivers behind product returns and predict high-risk transactions using logistic regression. A Power BI dashboard was created for business users to explore return patterns and insights interactively.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To reduce return-related losses by:
- Analyzing return behavior by product, region, and customer features
- Predicting the probability of returns using logistic regression
- Providing a list of high-risk transactions
- Visualizing actionable insights through Power BI

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- **Power BI**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **GitHub**
- **CSV, Excel**

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features
- Return rate by product category, region, customer rating, and discount
- KPI card showing average return rate
- Slicers for Region, Product Category, and Customer Rating
- Clean, interactive layout with dynamic filtering

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- Used logistic regression to classify return likelihood
- Input features: `Customer_Rating`, `Discount_Applied`, `Quantity`, `Order_Amount`
- Output: `return_flag` + `Return_Probability`

---

## 📁 Deliverables
- `Return_Rate_Analysis.pbix`: Interactive dashboard
- `E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis-Report.pdf`: 1-page project summary
- `ReturnRateAnalysis.ipynb`: Project Code
- `high_risk_products.csv`: Exported transactions with high return probability
- `E-Commerce_Customer_Analytics.csv`: Original Dataset

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Higher discounts are strongly linked with higher returns
- Low customer ratings are predictive of return risk
- Some product categories and regions consistently show higher return rates

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Monitor and limit discounts in high-return categories
- Improve product quality in low-rated areas
- Refine return policies by region and product type
